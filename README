# Overview
GEPfiretracking originated from a work being done in Idaho to track which fires had occured in
which counties and what lands had been affected. This process was originally being done manually
in google earth pro. In order to finish the process for all of Idaho manually it might have
taken a year to complete. We were able to automate the process with this project and to
run our script on the all the fire data and land data for the state it took us about a half
hour.
